    question: "What Is Autonomous Testing?",
    answer:
      "Autonomous Testing is an AI-driven approach that automatically generates, executes, and maintains test cases without human intervention. Unlike traditional test automation that requires manual script creation, autonomous systems use machine learning to understand application behavior and dynamically create comprehensive test coverage.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How Is This Different From Test Automation?",
    answer:
      "Traditional automation relies on manually written scripts, whereas autonomous testing adapts automatically to changes using AI and self-healing mechanisms.",
  },
